## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to scrape data from a real website using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests, and then perform data analysis using Pandas. The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Structure
- `web-scraping-pandas.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation of the web scraping and data analysis process.

## Libraries Used
- `requests`: To fetch the content of the web page.
- `BeautifulSoup`: To parse the HTML content.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `Jupyter Notebook`: To create and run the notebook.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. 

### Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook web-scraping-pandas.ipynb
    ```

2. Run the cells in the notebook to see the scraping and data analysis in action.

## Project Details
- **Step 1**: Fetch the webpage content using the `requests` library.
- **Step 2**: Parse the HTML content using `BeautifulSoup`.
- **Step 3**: Extract specific data points from the HTML.
- **Step 4**: Store the extracted data in a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
- **Step 5**: Perform various data analysis tasks using Pandas.
